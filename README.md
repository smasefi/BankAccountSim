# BankAccountSim

This is a very simple first round implementation of a mobile banking system. There is a 
command line interface that allows the user to input values based on a choice they make
on a reappearing main menu. 

The user is able to check account status, withdraw, and deposit money into an account.

In a future version, I plan on creating a database where there are actual accounts 
where the user is able to log in and out of their account based on their log in information
within the database.
